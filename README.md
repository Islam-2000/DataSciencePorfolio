# Welcome to My Data Portfolio ðŸ“Š
## Overview

Welcome! This repository is a showcase of my journey as a data professional. Here, you'll find a collection of projects that highlight my skills, creativity, and passion for turning raw data into meaningful insights.
What's Inside?

    Project 1: Apple Store Analysis Dashboard
        This project explores applications in the app store and identifies trends and patterns such as price, app ratings, 
        and application accessibility based on a variety of factors and displaying it in a visually appealling dashboard.
      
        Skills: Spreadsheets, Data Cleaning, Dashboards, Analysis

    Project 2: Movie Dataset Data Cleaning
        A comprehensive data cleaning to mitigate erroneous, missing, or inconsistent data. This is performed using
        data formatting, checking for data duplicates, data consistency across fields and improving data readability.
        
        Skills: Spreadsheets, Functions, Data Formatting & Cleaning

    Project 3: English Premier League Results Analysis
        The purpose of this project is to use SQL to explore EPL data and gain a deeper understanding of the data, 
        as well as preparing and cleaning the data if needed.
        
        Skills: SQL, MySQL, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Formatting & Cleaning

    Project 4: Employee Turnover Analysis 
        A project that uses SQL (MySQL) to explore data concerning companies and the number of laid off employees. 
        SQL is used to explore the data, format it, and clean it in preparation to be exported to Google Sheets 
        for analysis and building a comprehensive dashboard.
        
        Skills: SQL, MySQL, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Dashboard Design

    Project 5: Multi-Class Texture Classification Using Error-Correcting Output Codes and Gaussian Mixture Models
        This project covers the results of applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms in ECOC and GMM 
        respectively. Data preparation and preprocessing methods are highlighted alongside some other techniques
        such as dimensionality reduction and feature engineering performed on the Describable Texture Dataset (DTD).

        Skills: Data Visualisation, Data Preparation & Preprocessing, Machine Learning Algorithms, Hyperparameter Optimization
        
    Project 6: Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm 
        The purpose of this project aims to leverage Dijkstra's Algorithm on a custom-made graph dataset using Excel solver. 
        Results indicate that the minimum cost from a source node to a destination node was indeed the minimum path. However,
        there are still improvements and other algorithms to be considered that could yield better performance from an space
        and time-complexity perspective.

        Skills: Excel Solver, Advanced Algorithms
        
    Project 7: Extracting Bag-Of-Visual-Words For Hybrid Optical Character Recognition 
        This project aims to extract a series of text characters from text images and performing clustering techniques. 
        Several strategies were used such as image thresholding, extracting connected components in order to separate 
        the various letters and symbols. This was conducted on 3 languages: English, Arabic, and Russian. Results 
        indicated that applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) alongside agglomerative clustering produced
        tighter clusters of the same characters or symbols. 

        Skills: Feature Extraction, Clustering, Computer Vision, Image Analysis
        
    Project 8:
