What's Inside?

    Project 1: Apple Store Analysis Dashboard
        This project explores applications in the app store and identifies trends and patterns such as price, app ratings, 
        and application accessibility based on a variety of factors and displaying it in a visually appealling dashboard.
      
        Skills: Spreadsheets, Data Cleaning, Dashboards, Analysis

    Project 2: Movie Dataset Data Cleaning
        A comprehensive data cleaning to mitigate erroneous, missing, or inconsistent data. This is performed using
        data formatting, checking for data duplicates, data consistency across fields and improving data readability.
        
        Skills: Spreadsheets, Functions, Data Formatting & Cleaning

    Project 3: English Premier League Results Analysis
        The purpose of this project is to use SQL to explore EPL data and gain a deeper understanding of the data, 
        as well as preparing and cleaning the data if needed.
        
        Skills: SQL, MySQL, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Formatting & Cleaning

    Project 4: Employee Turnover Analysis 
        A project that uses SQL (MySQL) to explore data concerning companies and the number of laid off employees. 
        SQL is used to explore the data, format it, and clean it in preparation to be exported to Google Sheets 
        for analysis and building a comprehensive dashboard.
        
        Skills: SQL, MySQL, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Dashboard Design

    Project 5: Multi-Class Texture Classification Using Error-Correcting Output Codes and Gaussian Mixture Models
        This project covers the results of applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms in ECOC and GMM 
        respectively. Data preparation and preprocessing methods are highlighted alongside some other techniques
        such as dimensionality reduction and feature engineering performed on the Describable Texture Dataset (DTD).

        Skills: Data Visualisation, Data Preparation & Preprocessing, Machine Learning Algorithms, Hyperparameter Optimization
        
    Project 6: Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm 
        The purpose of this project aims to leverage Dijkstra's Algorithm on a custom-made graph dataset using Excel solver. 
        Results indicate that the minimum cost from a source node to a destination node was indeed the minimum path. However,
        there are still improvements and other algorithms to be considered that could yield better performance from an space
        and time-complexity perspective.

        Skills: Excel Solver, Advanced Algorithms
        
    Project 7: Extracting Bag-Of-Visual-Words For Hybrid Optical Character Recognition 
        This project aims to extract a series of text characters from text images and performing clustering techniques. 
        Several strategies were used such as image thresholding, extracting connected components in order to separate 
        the various letters and symbols. This was conducted on 3 languages: English, Arabic, and Russian. Results 
        indicated that applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) alongside agglomerative clustering produced
        tighter clusters of the same characters or symbols. 

        Skills: Feature Extraction, Clustering, Computer Vision, Image Analysis
        
    Project 8: Music Genre Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks and Machine Learning Classifiers
        The purpose of this project was to explore and classify different music genres I loved using neural networks
        with an emphasis on feature extraction methods such as extracting Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and 
        others. A variety of supervised classifiers were also deployed in tandem with the proposed algorithm. 
        Results indicated that the proposed deep learning algorithm outperformed all supervised classifiers.

        Skills: Deep Learning, Feature Extraction, Hyperparameter Optimization, Music Data Extraction & Analysis

    Project 9: Data Visualization and Mining on Music Track Features
        I employed various techniques in this data mining project including PCA, univariate & bivariate data 
        exploration, multivariate outlier detection methods, cluster analysis, and more. This was operated on a
        collection of music track features such as tempo, energy, loudness, etc..

        Skills: Data Visualization, Cluster Analysis, Multidimensional Scaling, Outlier Detection, Association Methods

    Project 10: Predicting Power Output of Solar Panels in Cairo, Egypt
        This paper analyses recent historical weather data in Cairo and performs predictive analytics using various
        machine learning algorithms such as MLP, Lasso Regression, and others to identify the most effective 
        model. A certain limitation of this experiment was the lack of recent data, which made our analysis slightly
        outdated for conducting our research.

        Skills: Regression, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning & Transformation, Hyperparameter Optimization

    Project 11: Optimizing Production to Maximize Profit
        This project investigated Saudi Food Company data and optimized a linear programming problem for optimizing
        the production of 10 different juice flavors to maximize the company's profit and optimize the production 
        schedule by utilizing sensitivity analysis.

        Skills: Linear Programming, Sensitivity Analysis, Problem Formulation, Simplex & Dual Methods

    Project 12: Regression Analysis on World University Rankings
        Regression analysis was performed on the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) dataset. A collection
        of tests were conducted on the data such as transformation of variables, regression diagnostics, outlier
        identification, leverage points, influential observations, and model fitting. 

        Skills: Regression Analysis, Outlier Detection, Data Exploration
