## Overview

Welcome! This repository is a showcase of my journey as a data professional. Here, you'll find a collection of projects that highlight my skills, creativity, and passion for turning raw data into meaningful insights.
What's Inside?

    Project 1: Apple Store Analysis Dashboard
        This project explores applications in the app store and identifies trends and patterns such as price, app ratings, 
        and application accessibility based on a variety of factors and displaying it in a visually appealling dashboard.
        Skills Used: Spreadsheets, Data Cleaning, Dashboards, Analysis

    Project 2: Movie Dataset Data Cleaning
        A comprehensive data cleaning to mitigate erroneous, missing, or inconsistent data. This is performed using
        data formatting, checking for data duplicates, data consistency across fields and improving data readability.
        Skills Used: Spreadsheets, Functions, Data Formatting & Cleaning

    Project 3: English Premier League Results Analysis
        The purpose of this project is to use SQL to explore EPL data and gain a deeper understanding of the data, as well as preparing and cleaning the data if needed.
        Skills Used: SQL, MySQL, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Formatting & Cleaning

    Project 4: Employee Turnover Analysis 
        A project that uses SQL (MySQL) to explore data concerning companies and the number of laid off employees. SQL is used to explore the data, format it, and clean it in preparation to be 
        exported to Google Sheets for analysis and building a comprehensive dashboard.
        Skills Used: SQL, MySQL, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Dashboard Design

    Project 5: Multi-Class Texture Classification Using Error-Correcting Output Codes and Gaussian Mixture Models
        This project covers the results of applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms in ECOC and GMM 
        respectively. Data preparation and preprocessing methods are highlighted alongside some other techniques such as dimensionality reduction 
        and feature engineering performed on the Describable Texture Dataset (DTD).
